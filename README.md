XDM-main-plugin-repo
====================

Some advanced plugins for XDM.
May need my modified XDM-develop branch for every plugin to work: https://github.com/pannal/XDM/tree/develop


The official main Plugin Repository for [https://github.com/lad1337/XDM](https://github.com/lad1337/XDM)<br>


The issue with this repo is that all plugins are downloaded on a single request.<br>
But that could be easily changed if the download url link to different zip files.<br>

XDM >= 0.5.0 can batch install plugins and if and does not redownload the same file in a batch.


Please feel free to use these plugins to create your own plugin(s).

## Development

Easiest way to create your JSON is to use the "repoJSONmaker.py" that comes with XDM (>=0.5.0)

e.g. my run command for the dev branch is:

    python repoJSONmaker.py --download_url https://github.com/lad1337/XDM-main-plugin-repo/archive/dev.zip --info_url https://github.com/lad1337/XDM-main-plugin-repo/tree/dev --name XDM\ main\ repo --path /Volumes/HDD/lad1337/workspace/XDM-main-plugin-repo/

This will load all of the plugins in **/Volumes/HDD/lad1337/workspace/XDM-main-plugin-repo/** and write the meta.json into it with all the info extracted from the plugins.
It also warns about missing identifiers or wrong plugin folder names.
